Great! You're on the right track to simulate an ARM platform like the **Versatile Express (vexpress)** board using **QEMU**, **Linux 5.10.99**, and **BusyBox**.

Here’s a high-level guide to help you set things up:

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Setup for QEMU with `vexpress` Board

#### **1. Install Required Packages (on your Ubuntu host)**

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo apt update sudo apt install qemu-system-arm build-essential gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi u-boot-tools libncurses-dev flex bison wget`

---

#### **2. Download and Extract Linux Kernel**

bash

CopyEdit

`wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.10.99.tar.xz tar -xvf linux-5.10.99.tar.xz cd linux-5.10.99`

---

#### **3. Configure the Kernel for `vexpress`**

bash

CopyEdit

`make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- vexpress_defconfig`

You can customize with menuconfig (optional):

bash

CopyEdit

`make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- menuconfig`

---

#### **4. Build the Kernel Image**

bash

CopyEdit

`make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- -j$(nproc) zImage dtbs`

Output will be in:

- `arch/arm/boot/zImage`
    
- `arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb` (use this DTB for QEMU)
    

---

#### **5. Build BusyBox (minimal rootfs)**

bash

CopyEdit

`wget https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.36.1.tar.bz2 tar -xvf busybox-1.36.1.tar.bz2 cd busybox-1.36.1 make defconfig`

Enable static build:

bash

CopyEdit

`make menuconfig # Enable: Settings → Build static binary (no shared libs)`

Then build and install:

bash

CopyEdit

`make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- -j$(nproc) make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- install`

This installs to `_install/` directory.

---

#### **6. Create a Root Filesystem (initramfs)**

bash

CopyEdit

`mkdir -p rootfs/{proc,sys,dev,etc,tmp} cp -a _install/* rootfs/ sudo cp -a /dev/{null,console} rootfs/dev/`

Create an init script:

bash

CopyEdit

`cat > rootfs/init << EOF #!/bin/sh mount -t proc none /proc mount -t sysfs none /sys echo -e "\nWelcome to BusyBox on QEMU!" exec /bin/sh EOF chmod +x rootfs/init`

Create initramfs image:

bash

CopyEdit

`cd rootfs find . | cpio -H newc -o | gzip > ../initramfs.cpio.gz cd ..`

---

#### **7. Run QEMU**

bash

CopyEdit

`qemu-system-arm \   -M vexpress-a9 \   -m 512M \   -kernel linux-5.10.99/arch/arm/boot/zImage \   -dtb linux-5.10.99/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb \   -initrd initramfs.cpio.gz \   -nographic \   -append "console=ttyAMA0"`

---

### ✅ Output

You should see the boot logs and get a shell prompt like:

sh

CopyEdit

`/ #` 

This means your QEMU + Linux + BusyBox is working correctly!

---

If you need:

- A minimal ext4 rootfs instead of initramfs
    
- Networking support (with `-net nic -net user`)
    
- U-Boot bootloader before the kernel
    

Let me know and I can help you with that too.

###### ChatGPT said:

The message you're seeing during BusyBox linking:

vbnet

CopyEdit

`Static linking against glibc, can't use --gc-sections Trying libraries: m resolv rt ... Final link with: m resolv`

is **not an error** — it's just **informational output** from BusyBox's linker stage. Here's what it means:

---

### 🔍 What This Message Means

- **"Static linking against glibc"**  
    You're building a statically linked BusyBox binary against **glibc**, not musl or uClibc.
    
- **"can't use --gc-sections"**  
    The linker option `--gc-sections` (garbage collect unused sections) can't be used with glibc static linking — this is a known limitation.
    
- **"Library m is needed"**, **"Library resolv is needed"**  
    The linker checks what libraries are required and decides to link against:
    
    - `libm` → math library
        
    - `libresolv` → DNS resolution
        

This message is **normal** and means the linker is smartly minimizing the dependencies.

---

### ✅ If It Succeeds

If after this step it shows:

nginx

CopyEdit

`LINK    busybox_unstripped`

And later:

nginx

CopyEdit

  `UNSTRIPPING busybox   ...   INSTALL  busybox`

Then **everything is working fine** — you can proceed to install with:

bash

CopyEdit

`make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- install`

and continue building your `initramfs`.

---

### 🔧 Optional Tip: Use musl for cleaner static build

If you're aiming for a **fully static** BusyBox binary with **no glibc dependencies**, consider using **musl**:

Install musl cross compiler:

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo apt install musl-tools`

Or download a prebuilt toolchain like:

- https://musl.cc/
    

Then configure BusyBox to use it:

bash

CopyEdit

``make menuconfig # → Settings → Build static binary # Use musl cross compiler (e.g. `CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-musleabi-`)``

This will avoid glibc quirks and give you smaller, more portable binaries.

---

Let me know if your build fails at any later step — I can help debug it.

##### You said:

how can i know if the make is success about the busybox

###### ChatGPT said:

To **confirm whether the BusyBox `make` build was successful**, here's what you should check:

---

### ✅ 1. Check for Final Output Lines

After running:

bash

CopyEdit

`make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- -j$(nproc)`

A **successful build** will end with something like this:

nginx

CopyEdit

  `LINK    busybox_unstripped   UNSTRIPPING busybox`

or:

nginx

CopyEdit

  `LINK    busybox`

Then no errors or "Error 1" below that. If there is no line like `*** [some target] Error 1`, it’s usually successful.

---

### ✅ 2. Check if the `busybox` Binary Was Created

After a successful `make`, you should have a `busybox` binary in the root of the BusyBox source tree:

bash

CopyEdit

`ls -lh busybox`

You should see output like:

sql

CopyEdit

`-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 1.1M Jul 22  busybox`

If the file exists and is a valid executable, the build succeeded.

---

### ✅ 3. Try Running `file` on It (to verify architecture)

bash

CopyEdit

`file busybox`

Expected output (if cross-compiling for ARM):

arduino

CopyEdit

`busybox: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, ...`

If you see something like `x86-64`, it means your toolchain didn’t cross-compile properly.

---

### ✅ 4. (Optional) Try Running It with QEMU

If you want to test it directly:

bash

CopyEdit

`qemu-arm ./busybox`

If it prints usage/help text like:

vbnet

CopyEdit

`BusyBox v1.36.1 (2025-07-22 01:23:45 UTC) multi-call binary. Usage: busybox [function] [arguments]...`

Then it's working!

---

### ✅ 5. Proceed to Install (if build succeeded)

Now you can install BusyBox into the minimal root filesystem:

bash

CopyEdit

`make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- install`

Which installs into `_install/` directory by default. Check it:

bash

CopyEdit

`ls -l _install/`

---

If you **don’t see the `busybox` binary** or get an error like `Error 1` or `undefined reference`, paste that here — I’ll help fix it.

##### You said:

go on, i need to where to create the root filesystem about the vexpress

###### ChatGPT said:

Great — let’s **create the root filesystem** for your `vexpress` QEMU system. Since you’re using **BusyBox**, we’ll build a **simple initramfs** (initial RAM filesystem) which QEMU will load into memory during boot.

---

### 📦 1. **Directory Layout for Root Filesystem**

Create the root filesystem structure (starting from your BusyBox directory):

bash

CopyEdit

`mkdir -p rootfs/{bin,sbin,etc,proc,sys,usr/{bin,sbin},dev,tmp}`

Then copy BusyBox binaries:

bash

CopyEdit

`cp -a _install/* rootfs/`

Add device files (required for console):

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo mknod -m 622 rootfs/dev/console c 5 1 sudo mknod -m 666 rootfs/dev/null c 1 3`

---

### 📝 2. **Create Init Script**

Create an init script that BusyBox will run as PID 1 (in `rootfs/init`):

bash

CopyEdit

`cat > rootfs/init << 'EOF' #!/bin/sh mount -t proc none /proc mount -t sysfs none /sys echo echo "🎉 Booted BusyBox on QEMU vexpress!" /bin/sh EOF  chmod +x rootfs/init`

This script is **required**, or the kernel will panic saying:  
`No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel.`

---

### 📦 3. **Create Initramfs Archive**

Compress the rootfs into an `initramfs.cpio.gz` archive:

bash

CopyEdit

`cd rootfs find . | cpio -H newc -o | gzip > ../initramfs.cpio.gz cd ..`

You now have your root filesystem ready as `initramfs.cpio.gz`.

---

### 🚀 4. **Run QEMU with Your RootFS**

bash

CopyEdit

`qemu-system-arm \   -M vexpress-a9 \   -m 512M \   -kernel linux-5.10.99/arch/arm/boot/zImage \   -dtb linux-5.10.99/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb \   -initrd initramfs.cpio.gz \   -append "console=ttyAMA0 root=/dev/ram init=/init" \   -nographic`

You should see Linux boot logs and then:

csharp

CopyEdit

`🎉 Booted BusyBox on QEMU vexpress! / #`

Now you're inside your custom rootfs!

---

### ✅ Summary

|Component|Location|
|---|---|
|Linux kernel|`linux-5.10.99/arch/arm/boot/zImage`|
|DTB|`linux-5.10.99/arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb`|
|Root filesystem|`initramfs.cpio.gz`|
|BusyBox binary|Copied into `rootfs/bin` and symlinked|

---

Would you like to:

- Add networking support?
    
- Mount ext4 rootfs instead of initramfs?
    
- Use U-Boot before the kernel?
